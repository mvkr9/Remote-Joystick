This project is used to send the joystick data of client to a host.
more like steam remoteplay (Without Video , will be updated in the next update).
Benifits? it has very low latencey.


## Pre-requisite packages:

pip install pygame 

pip install pyvjoy

## At client:
python and pygame are needed.

just set in the appropriate ipaddress.

run joystickMapping

## At Host:
Install Vjoy  http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/download-a-install/download

configure the number of devices needed & up the number of buttons to 14

If using application like LogmeinHamachi no portforwarding required. 

Else port forward and use the same port in the host program 

run pythonController

for better results and calibration use X360ce
